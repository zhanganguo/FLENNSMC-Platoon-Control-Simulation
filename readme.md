### üìö Project Overview

This project implements a novel Fuzzy Logic-Enhanced Neuroadaptive Sliding Mode Control (FLENNSMC) framework designed to tackle complex challenges in stochastic vehicular platoon systems. Modern platoons operate in dynamic 2D environments, facing issues like nonlinear dynamics, time-varying communication delays, Markovian jump parameters, dangerous actuator faults with unknown directions, and stringent asymmetric spacing constraints. This work provides a robust and adaptive solution to these interconnected problems.

### ‚ú® Key Features & Contributions

*   **Integrated Control Framework:** Synergistically combines fuzzy logic, Radial Basis Function Neural Networks (RBFNNs), Sliding Mode Control (SMC), asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Functions (BLFs), and Nussbaum functions into a comprehensive FLENNSMC framework.
*   **Structured Neuroadaptation (FLERBFNN):** Leverages fuzzy logic to enhance RBFNNs, enabling a structured and localized learning process. This leads to faster convergence, improved computational efficiency, and better interpretability compared to traditional monolithic RBFNNs.
*   **Guaranteed Spacing Constraints:** Utilizes an asymmetric BLF to strictly enforce safety and communication distance constraints, preventing collisions and maintaining platoon cohesion.
*   **Fault Tolerance:** Employs Nussbaum functions to effectively compensate for actuator faults with unknown directions, ensuring system stability even under critical fault conditions.
*   **Robustness to Stochasticity & Delays:** Accounts for Markovian jump parameters and time-varying delays in the system model and control design, enhancing resilience in uncertain environments.
*   **Rigorous Stability Guarantees:** Provides a detailed stochastic Lyapunov-Krasovskii analysis, combined with Linear Matrix Inequality (LMI) techniques, to prove Uniform Ultimate Boundedness (UUB) of tracking errors and guarantee mixed $\mathcal{H}_{\infty}$/passivity performance.
*   **Comparative Performance Validation:** Demonstrates superior tracking accuracy, enhanced robustness, and improved computational efficiency through extensive simulations, outperforming conventional neuroadaptive and standard SMC approaches.

### ‚ùì Problem Statement

Controlling vehicular platoons is challenging due to inherent nonlinear dynamics, communication delays, and environmental uncertainties. When combined with stochastic operational modes (Markovian jumps), unknown-direction actuator faults, and strict asymmetric spacing requirements, these challenges demand sophisticated control strategies that can ensure safety, stability, and performance simultaneously. Traditional linear or even some nonlinear adaptive methods often fall short in addressing this complex multi-faceted problem in a unified, robust, and computationally efficient manner.

### üí° Methodology (FLENNSMC)

The proposed FLENNSMC framework integrates several advanced techniques:

1.  **Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) Fuzzy Model:** Used to capture the system's stochastic behavior and partition the state space, enabling localized learning.
2.  **Fuzzy Logic-Enhanced RBFNN (FLERBFNN):** Within each fuzzy rule, an RBFNN is employed to approximate unknown nonlinear functions (unmodeled dynamics, bias faults). Fuzzy rules guide the RBFNN's learning, making it more efficient and interpretable.
3.  **Backstepping Control Design:** A recursive design approach ensures systematic stability.
4.  **Sliding Mode Control (SMC):** Integrated for its inherent robustness against uncertainties and disturbances.
5.  **Asymmetric Barrier Lyapunov Function (BLF):** Ensures that inter-vehicle distance errors strictly remain within predefined safety bounds, crucial for collision avoidance and communication maintenance.
6.  **Nussbaum Function:** Adaptively compensates for the unknown sign (direction) of actuator faults, allowing the controller to function effectively even when the fault characteristics are not fully known.
7.  **Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals & LMI:** Used for rigorous mean-square stability analysis, accounting for time-delays and Markovian jumps, and deriving computable LMI conditions for performance guarantees.

### üöÄ Getting Started

This repository includes two main simulation scenarios, corresponding to "simulation 1" (Integrated Performance) and "simulation 2" (Comparative Performance) in the paper.

#### Scenario 1: Integrated Performance

This scenario evaluates the FLENNSMC framework's comprehensive ability to handle all challenges simultaneously. It generates individual plots for position tracking, various errors, control inputs, and adaptive parameter behaviors.

1.  **Run the Simulation:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt in the root directory of the cloned repository.
    ```bash
    python simulation_1.py
    ```
    The simulation results (plots corresponding to Figures 1-5 in the paper) will be automatically generated and displayed, then saved in the `figures/` directory.

#### Scenario 2: Comparative Performance

This scenario compares the performance of the proposed FLENNSMC with a Traditional RBFNN-based controller and a standard Sliding Mode Controller (SMC).

1.  **Run the Simulation:**
    Open your terminal or command prompt in the root directory of the cloned repository.
    ```bash
    python simulation_2.py
    ```
    The simulation will run all three controllers sequentially and then generate comparative plots (corresponding to Figures 6-7 in the paper) and print a performance metrics table in the console. Plots will also be saved in the `figures/` directory.

### üìä Results & Analysis

The `figures/` directory contains all the plots generated from both simulation scenarios, validating the proposed FLENNSMC framework's performance.
